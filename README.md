DropIT is a file sharing platform that makes file sharing across the internet simple and fast. With DropIT, you don't need an account to share a file of any type, and you can share it with anyone using a simple, memorable code similar to an OTP.

### What problem did DropIT solve? 🤔

I'll share one of my experiences here. I was in a situation where I needed to share a small file with 20 computers from my phone within 5 minutes. All the computers had an internet connection, but no file-sharing options were available, and I didn't have any cables with me. I had two options: first, log in to my email on all systems and send the file via email (which is not possible in 5 minutes), or second, upload it to Google Drive and download it on each system (but Drive links are too complex to type manually on all systems). That's why I couldn't complete the task.

#### If DropIT was available, what would I do? 💡

If DropIT was available, I would upload my file to [DropIT](https://drop-it.web.app), set the usage limit to 20, and then get the code for that file. The code would be simple and memorable, like *A-956233*. Then I could go to each system, type in this code, and boom 💥, the file would be downloaded.
